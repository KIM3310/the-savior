# Ad-Supported Resource and Aggregate Data Architecture

Repository: `the-savior`

## Public Resource Model

Free narrative prototype planning sheet for branching content and lightweight public demos.

- Audience: interactive fiction builders and prototype reviewers
- Central resource: https://kim3310-doeon-kim-portfolio.pages.dev/resources/the-savior/
- Live system: https://kim3310.github.io/the-savior/
- Advertising boundary: ads allowed only on public narrative-design pages; saved play state, personal notes, and result flows are ad-free
- Current ad state: code-ready on the central resource; serving depends on Google AdSense site approval and consent policy.

## Readiness Utility

The central resource turns the repository architecture into a practical review checklist:

- **Architecture Summary:** Repository-local proof surface for agent runtime reliability and AI workflow orchestration, backed by Node/TypeScript runtime, GitHub Actions validation.
- **Runtime And Data Flow:** Primary domain: agent runtime reliability and AI workflow orchestration.
- **Cloud Or Local Deployment Boundary:** Operating model: stateless runtimes, provider adapters, queue-aware execution, telemetry, and controlled secret boundaries
- **Deployment patterns:** Edge-first deployment model with server-side AI adapters and public-safe secrets handling Stateless agent gateway with provider abstraction, retries, cost controls, and trace capture
- **Control boundaries:** identity boundary and least-privilege service access environment separation for local, staging, and managed runtime paths secret storage outside source and deterministic fallback for missing credentials observability hooks for logs, metrics, traces, and audit events rollback path...

The checklist state remains in the visitor's browser and is not transmitted.

## Aggregate Data Boundary

- Data asset: anonymous aggregate narrative-design topic interest and resource CTA counts
- Sensitivity class: consumer-guarded
- Allowed events: `resource_view`, `resource_cta_click`, `architecture_doc_open`, `privacy_support_open`
- Prohibited fields: `raw_input`, `url`, `referrer`, `title`, `user_id`, `session_id`, `ip_address`, `device_id`, `payment_detail`
- Consent defaults to off.
- DNT and Global Privacy Control fail closed.
- Events are reduced to repository, allowlisted event, public surface, and consent-policy version.
- Personal, sensitive, raw, event-level, or re-identifiable data is never offered for sale.

## Storage Path

```text
Public resource
  -> consent and privacy-signal gate
  -> Cloudflare Pages event API
  -> rate-limited daily aggregate counter
  -> public benchmark response
  -> Firebase public aggregate data mart
```

Cloudflare D1 holds operational counters. Firestore project `kim3310-free-tools` is the deny-by-default public aggregate data mart. Private inquiries remain isolated from telemetry.
